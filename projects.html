              Kadugli County has granted Kulu 10,000 acres of farmland for
              farming practice. The goal of our project is to provide meals for
              school children because most of them often leave homes early in
              the morning without eating breakfast and walk far distances to
              attend classes. The schools don’t have meal programs either. This
              feeding program will make the learning environment more favorable
              for kids. We also want to provide rations to teachers and school
              employees. The county is committed to granting us more land as
              long as the program continues. In the slideshow images, you can
              see our farm-workers are sowing sorghum (grain) in July 2018.

              The conflict has caused an immense disruption and a tremendous
              destruction of educational infrastructures and facilities in the
              Nuba Mountains. Some students have crossed the border to South
              Sudan to attend schools in refugee camps, but the majority of them
              got cut off in the caves with their families. Most teachers have
              followed their students to refugee camps where they can teach
              while receiving rations corresponding to the salaries they could
              have earned. This situation is contributing to the growing
              illiteracy, which is disheartening. In the slideshow is our 8th
              grade students in Kadugli County. We’re planning to open a high
              school for them in 2021.

              Healthcare has always been insignificant program in the government
              services particularly in the marginalized states. Nuba Mountains;
              for example, has been denied the immunization campaign since 2011.
              The former government of Al Bashir bombed and destroyed most
              hospitals and clinics in areas under the administration of the
              SPLM-N; consequently, thousands people have died. We are building
              a new facility in Sangali Hospital that consists of three rooms:
              an operation, a labor, and a waiting room. Hopefully this project
              will be done by March 31, 2020. See the slideshow images.

              Clean drinking water has been a critical issue for the
              marginalized inhabitants since the establishment of the state of
              Sudan. People walk far distances to fetch stagnant dirty water
              from lakes, polluted reservoirs or streams for drinking. This is
              one of injustices that people of the Nuba Mountains have been
              enduring for a very long time. Many people die each day from
              diseases associated with lack of clean drinking water. In the
              slideshow images, there is a boy drinking from the stagnant water
              and two girls fetching dirty water from the stream for drinking.
              Our long-term goal is to initiate the water supply network by
              drilling wells and installing hand or engine water pumps so that
              the residents are able to access to clean drinking water.
