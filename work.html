              The Nuba Mountains region is rich with good soils and abundant
              rainfalls, and that makes the inhabitants an agrarian society
              since the ancient civilization of the Nile Valley. Agricultural
              production is the cornerstone to the region’s economy but it has
              been affected in recent years due to the conflict that inundated
              the entire region. The people in rural areas grow a variety of
              indigenous food crops such as sorghum, millet, maize or corn,
              beans, cow-pea, groundnuts or peanuts, roselle or hibiscus, and
              sesame. Cotton is mainly grown as a commercial commodity.<br />

              We want to shift the old fashioned agricultural practices to
              modern practices by providing the farmers with basic farm inputs:
              seeds, fertilizers, tools and equipment to increase the efficiency
              and production. Our primary goal is to support the community in
              creating a sustainable agricultural sector, so that they secure
              their own food. We want people to be self-sufficient in providing
              for their food needs and not risking their lives by surrendering
              to the government cities in search of food. We see the National
              Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) persecuting innocent
              civilians every day when they flee the Nuba Mountains to areas
              under the administration of the government due to starvation. Our
              agriculture program is primarily designed to motivate farmers to
              extend their farmlands and to cultivate as large-fields as they
              can in order to yield good production so that they may be able to
              sell the surplus.

              The system of centralization government that was installed in the
              country since its independence in 1956 was aimed to marginalize
              the indigenous populations especially the Nubans. Therefore, we
              cannot blame only the current government for denying education to
              the people of Nuba Mountains, but also all the consecutive
              governments that have governed the country since its
              establishment. In Nuba Mountains regions, the government builds
              only Primary or Elementary schools and students who graduate from
              this level are on their own to find higher education. Due to the
              poor education system, we fight illiteracy and promote education
              by constructing schools, providing school supplies and granting
              scholarships for students who do not have the opportunity to
              access quality education. Although this development is moving
              slowly, we’re optimistic that it will improve in the future
              because we see the changes taking place in the region. We actively
              encourage the local populations to invest in education programs
              that we offer by engaging them in the community development
              program. This program gives them ideas for how to address the
              overall education issues; especially girls education for instance.
              Girls are more likely to drop out of schools than boys. Therefore,
              the community has to identify and solve the problems that lead to
              girls dropping out of schools. Investing in girls’ education is
              one of the challenges that our community hasn’t been able to
              address extensively up to this point.

              Most people in the Nuba Mountains have been using traditional
              remedies for the treatment of various diseases and injuries for
              long a time because of the government’s negligence. The health
              care system in Sudan has never been the top priority in the
              government’s programs, particularly in the peripheral states where
              indigenous people reside. In the capital Khartoum and other major
              cites, health insurances and healthcare services are limited to
              the government employees and their families only because the major
              providers of services are owned by the government. Therefore, less
              than 10% of the ordinary citizens in the cities can afford to pay
              for their healthcare coverage. As for civilians in the Nuba
              Mountains, there are no health services offered by the government
              of Sudan; except for the small support programs from Samaritan’s
              Purse and the Catholic Church. One of our major programs is a
              health program. We plan to provide healthcare services and
              sanitation programs to promote the well being of the vulnerable
              civilians; particularly, elderly people, women, and children.
              Pregnant women and children in the Nuba Mountains have not had
              access to any form of vaccinations since the recent war began on
              June 6, 2011. Sine then, the region has been deprived of the
              government’s services including health programs and the people
              have turned from drug to traditional remedies. Surprisingly, all
              other political parties in Khartoum take the government’s side
              when it comes to issues of marginalized regions.

              Sudan has the worst record of human rights violations in the
              entire continent of Africa. On top of the war crimes that the
              government has committed against people in South Sudan, Nuba
              Mountains, and Blue Nile region during first war from 1983 to
              2005, it scaled up to genocide in the Darfur region between 2003
              and 2005. In 2011, the government armed forces and their proxy
              militias re-orchestrated the same crimes they committed in Darfur
              region, in the Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile region again.
              Consequently, the former president Omar al Bashir and some of his
              top government officials have been indicted by the International
              Criminal Court (ICC), in 2009 on three count charges of genocide,
              war crimes, and crimes against humanity. al Bashir came to power
              through a military coupe in 1989 until he was ousted by the
              popular upraising in April 11, 2019 . We advocate to the world to
              join our efforts toward relieving the plight of the communities
              living in the conflict regions of Sudan. We do this by raising
              awareness and stay non-partisan, non-political and non-religious.
              Our goal is to advocate for the equal opportunities and
              elimination of all kinds of violence and human rights abuses
              against marginalized Sudanese. al Bashir was ousted on April 6,
              2019 by the peaceful popular uprising. Now it’s time to bring the
              former president along with his top government officials to
              justice. We appeal to AU, EU, U.S., Tripartite and the United
              Nation Security Council to stand in solidarity with Sudanese
              against the Transitional Military Council (TMC) in order to
              transform the status quo to civil government immediately. TMC is
              just a changed face of former government.
