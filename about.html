              In Nuba language, Kulu means a safe water source, a gush of clean
              geyser, or the beginning of a cool water stream where people and
              animals come to drink and rest. This is the life-giving mission of
              our organization, an agency committed to the welfare and thriving
              support of the people of the Nuba Mountains, Sudan. Kulu is a
              place of true refreshment that is surrounded by gardens of fruits
              and vegetables. It also surrounded by playgrounds and soccer or
              football and wrestling fields for the local youths’ recreation.
            </p>

            <p class="color-black">
              We are a team of philanthropists that came to exist in response to
              the war atrocities in the Nuba Mountains region. These atrocious
              war crimes incited by the Sudanese government in its inhuman
              attempt to obliterate the indigenous populations aiming to take
              control of their natural resources. Since June 6, 2011, the
              government has continuously attacked civilians in this southern
              region and blocked lifesaving humanitarian reliefs entering the
              devastated areas. As a result, hundreds of thousands of innocent
              people have lost their lives. The crisis persists to worsen day
              after day and we cannot keep silent while witnessing our family
              members, relatives, neighbors and friends suffer and in need of
              our help. That is why we started making contributions (of as
              little as $20 per family every month), which we sent to support
              people in the region. However, we felt we weren’t doing enough by
              this effort. hat is why we formed Kulu Development Organization to
              mobilize broader support from people of good-will who are
              compassionate about working to end human suffering around the
              world. We all can help to save lives. Not until February 2017,
              were we able to secure the fund and able to register Kulu in the
              United States.
            </p>

            <p class="color-black">
              Our first mission began in October 2011 when the situation became
              worst due to the government troops’ constant attacks, air strikes
              and long-range propelled rockets launching into the villages from
              near by barracks. The government armed forces and militias
              besieged and blocked all the sources of the basic need suppliers
              to the entire region. We proposed contribution in which we
              collected $3,500 and transferred to our representative in Kampala,
              Uganda where he bought first aid supplies and transported them to
              the Nuba Mountains. Some of the fund was used to pay school fees
              for students and medical bills for ill people in Juba, South
              Sudan. It wasn’t enough but it made a noticeable difference in
              many innocent lives. We were pleased to work and make at least a
              little difference in the community.
            </p>

            <p class="color-black">
              According to Sudan People’s Liberation Movement North (SPLMN),
              there are 1.2 million people trapped in caves in the Nuba
              Mountains where relief agencies are not able to reach them due to
              former Sudanese president, Al Bashir’s blockade order. They depend
              on the little crops they cultivate during rainy seasons, which
              lasts four to six months at the most. There is only one mission
              hospital (Mother Mercy Hospital) with only one doctor for the
              entire population of the Nuba Mountains. The illiteracy gap is
              increasingly in an alarming rate due to the isolation, which holds
              the region behind.
            </p>

            <p class="color-black">
              We are extremely anxious about the situation that our people have
              been experiencing throughout the history of Sudan; therefore,
              we’re keen to provide resources that will shape their lives for
              the better.
